# sac_pso_gui_project

## Overview
This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for modifying the `_evaluate` method in the `sac_pso_env.py` file, which is part of a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) environment. The GUI allows users to visualize the results of the original `_evaluate` method and make adjustments to its implementation.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the GUI application by executing the following command:
   ```
   python src/gui/main.py
   ```
2. Use the interface to modify the `_evaluate` method in `sac_pso_env.py`.
3. Visualize the output curves generated by the original `_evaluate` method.

## Functionality
- **Modify `_evaluate` Method**: Users can edit the implementation of the `_evaluate` method directly from the GUI.
- **Plot Viewer**: The application includes a plot viewer that displays the curves generated by the original `_evaluate` method, allowing users to see the effects of their modifications in real-time.

## Testing
The project includes a testing module (`test_sac_pso.py`) to ensure that the modifications made to the `_evaluate` method function as expected. Users can run the tests to validate their changes.
